# Twisty Little Passages

# WA, simply teleport to a randomly-chosen subset of the rooms, calculate the average edges, and assume it's a good estimate of the average edges of all the rooms
# Cons: When most rooms have low degree, and a small set of rooms have high degree â€” few enough that we are unlikely to find one of them by teleporting randomly
# If these rooms contribute a significant fraction of the total edges, then they must connect to a significant fraction of rooms. So we can find these with high probability by repeatedly teleporting to a random room and then walking through a random passage with the "W" command
