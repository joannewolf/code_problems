# The problem can be translated to a graph question
# Consider each {junction, stone} as a vertex, for each street (u, v), there will be new S edges {(u, s), (v, s)} for each stone type s
# The goal is to find the optimal cost{u, 1} over all junctions
# If a stone type s is given available in junction u, cost{u, s} = 0
# Using Bellmanâ€“Ford or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal cost, imagine a virtual single source, and the distance to each vertex is the cost
# V = N * S, E = M * S, O((E + V + R*N)logV) = O((N*S + M*S + R*N)log(N*S))
