# Specializing Villages
# https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/0000000000050e07/0000000000051134
# Key idea: Define d(v) as distance of shortest neighbor road, f(v) means the other village connected by shortest neighbor road
# After sorting the villages by increasing d(v), we assign v the opposite food of f(v); if f(v) doesn't have a food assigned, we can assign either food to v
# If a 0-length road connects villages x and y, any village v f(v) = x or y has two choices, it can get one food through r(v) and the other from a combination of r(v) and the 0-length road
# Cuz 0-length road must be the shortest neighbor road for x and y, the x and y must have different product
# Ans = 2^N, N = {v | f(f(v)) = v and l(f(v)) > l(v)} âˆª {v | d(v) > 0 and d(f(v)) = 0}
# O(VlogV)
